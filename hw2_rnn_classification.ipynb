         "updated 18 03 2021 16 32 ist created 18 03 2021 16 32 ist late last year a semi retired britishscientist co authored a petition to europe s medicines regulator the petitioners made a bold demand halt covid 19 vaccine clinical trials even bolder was their argument for doing so they speculated without providing evidence that the vaccines could cause infertility in women the document appeared on a germanwebsite on dec 1 scientists denounced the theory regulators weren t swayed either weeks later the europeanmedicines agency approved the europeanunion s first covid 19 shot co developed by pfizerinc but damage was already done advertisement social media quickly spread exaggerated claims that covid 19 jabs cause female infertility within weeks doctors and nurses in britainbegan reporting that concerned women were asking them whether it was true according to the royal college of obstetricians gynaecologists in january a survey by the kaiser family foundation kff a non profit organization found that 13 of unvaccinated people in the unitedstates had heard that covid 19 vaccines have been shown to cause infertility what gave the debunked claim credibility was that one of the petition s co authors michael yeadon wasn t just any scientist the 60 year old is a former vice president of pfizer where he spent 16 years as an allergy and respiratory researcher he later co founded a biotech firm that the swissdrugmaker novartispurchased for at least 325 million in recent months yeadon pronounced yee don has emerged as an unlikely hero of the so called anti vaxxers whose adherents question the safety of many vaccines including for the coronavirus the anti vaxxer movement has amplified yeadon s skeptical views about covid 19 vaccines and tests government mandated lockdowns and the arc of the pandemic yeadon has said he personally doesn t oppose the use of all vaccines but many health experts and government officials worry that opinions like his fuel vaccine hesitancy a reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated that could prolong the pandemic covid 19 has already killed more than 2 6 million people worldwide these claims are false dangerous and deeply irresponsible said a spokesman for britain s department of health social care when asked about yeadon s views covid 19 vaccines are the best way to protect people from coronavirus and will save thousands of lives recent reports of blood clots and abnormal bleeding in a small number of recipients of astrazeneca s covid 19 vaccine have cast doubt on that shot s safety leading several europeancountries to suspend its use the developments are likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy further although there is no evidence of a causative link between the astrazenecaproduct and the affected patients conditions yeadon didn t respond to requests for comment for this article in reporting this story reuters reviewed thousands of his tweets over the past two years along with other writings and statements it also interviewed five people who know him including four of his former colleagues at pfizer a pfizerspokesman declined to comment on yeadon and his stint with the company beyond emphasizing that there is no evidence that its vaccine which it developed with its germanpartner biontech causes infertility in women references to yeadon s petition appear on the website of a group founded by influential vaccine skeptic robert f kennedy jr scion of the americanpolitical dynasty who recently was banned on instagrambecause of his covid 19 vaccine posts syndicated writer and vaccine skeptic michelle malkin reported yeadon s concern about fertility in a column last month under the headline pregnant women beware of covid shots and a blog with an alarmist headline head of pfizerresearch covid vaccine is female sterilization was shared thousands of times on facebook the visage and views of yeadon widely identified as an ex vp of pfizer can be seen on social media in languages including german portuguese danishand czech a facebookpost carries a video from november in which yeadon claimed that the pandemic fundamentally is over the post has been viewed more than a million times in october yeadon wrote a column for the unitedkingdom s daily mailnewspaper that also appeared on mailonline one of the world s most visited news websites it declared that deaths caused by covid 19 which then totaled about 45 000 in britain will soon fizzle out and britons should immediately be allowed to resume normal life since then the disease has killed about another 80 000 people in the uk yeadon isn t the only respected scientist to have challenged the scientific consensus on covid 19 and expressed controversial views michael levitt a winner of the nobel prizefor chemistry told the stanford daily last summer that he expected the pandemic would end in the unitedstates in 2020 and kill no more than 175 000 americans a third of the current total and when we come to look back we re going to say that wasn t such a terrible disease and luc montagnier another nobel prizewinner said last year that he believed the coronavirus was created in a chineselab many experts doubt that but so far there is no way to prove or disprove it levitt told reuters that his projections about the pandemic in the unitedstates were wrong but he still believes covid 19 eventually won t be seen as a terrible disease and that lockdowns caused a great deal of collateral damage and may not have been needed montagnier didn t respond to a request for comment what gives yeadon particular credibility is the fact that he worked at pfizer says imran ahmed chief executive of the center for countering digital hate an organization that combats online misinformation yeadon s background gives his dangerous and harmful messages false credibility in a debate last fall in britain s house of commonsabout the government s response to the pandemic parliamentarian richard drax called yeadon an eminent scientist and cited his view that the virus is both manageable and nearing its end drax didn t respond to a request for comment more recently david kurten a member of the london assembly an elected body tweeted there is a real danger that covid 19 vaccines could leave women infertile the cure must not be worse than the disease kurten wrote he too didn t respond to a request for comment why yeadon transformed from mainstream scientist to covid 19 vaccine skeptic remains a mystery thousands of his tweets stretching back to the start of the pandemic document a dramatic shift in his views early on he supported a vaccine strategy but they offer few clues to explain his radical turnabout some former colleagues at pfizersay they no longer recognize the mikeyeadon they once knew they described him as a knowledgeable and intelligent man who always insisted on seeing evidence and generally avoided publicity one of those ex colleague",

         "drought tolerant plants thejunipers when i first developed a real interest in plants i was in the heyday of my zine writing career as my interest in gardening grew writing a zine about it became inevitable initially i envisioned the zine as a journal of sorts the journal of a budding horticulturist pun intentional since i was new to gardening and plants in general the zine was meant to follow my journey as i explored this new world a zine needs a name though so what would i call it it didnt take long for me to land on the juniper i was familiar with a common disdain for the unsightly overgrown neglected evergreen shrub full of spiders and cobwebs that for whatever reason was at one point planted right outside just about every house in america a fire hazard by the way i was aware that many people were resorting to tearing them out cursing as they battled the pokey dirty half dead things that was basically all i knew about junipers they were common landscape plants that were just as commonly despised my affection for freaks geeks outsiders and rejects led me to name my zine after a shrub that everyone hated i guess i just felt like we had something in common and that despite being the bane of peoples existence it deserved some recognition and it does junipers are an important species in their natural habitats in some areas they are dominant features to the point where entire plant communities are named after them consider the pinon juniper woodlandsof western north america prominent steppe habitats that occur throughout high desert regions and support diverse forms of wildlife unique to this part of the world dan johnson writes in the book steppes the pinon juniper zone dominates huge expanses of the west in varying stages of health providing a wealth of habitats and resources to the wildlife and the people who call it home johnson goes on to describe some of these habitats in the colorado plateau this zone is dominated by pinus edulis and juniperus osteosperma with j scopulorum occupying drainages with more moisture in the great basin p edulis is replaced by p monophylla as the dominant pinon pine still mixing with j osteosperma yet as one moves west this juniper is increasingly replaced by j occidentalis move farther north and j occidentalis dominates completely with neither pinon pine making an appearance the genus juniperus is in the cypress family cupressaceae and includes up to 67 species at least 13 of which are native to north america they are long lived plants that range from prostrate sprawling groundcovers to expansive bushy shrubs to tall narrow trees their foliage is evergreen and can be either needle like or scale like most juniper species have needle like foliage in their seedling and juvenile stages and then scale like foliage at maturity some species like j communis never develop scale like foliage junipers are gymnosperms so their reproductive structures are housed in cones however their cones are fleshy and so are commonly and mistakenly referred to as berries or fruits juniper cones are most often blue or gray blue but in some species they have a red brown or orange hue juniperus communis common juniper juniperus scopulorum rocky mountain juniper juniperus horizontalis horizontal juniper in general junipers are quite drought tolerant particularly those species that are adapted to hot dry climates again referring to pinon juniper steppes johnson writes in prolonged periods of drought the pinon pines seem to suffer long before the junipers whole hillsides of pine may go brown leaving islands of olive green juniper relatively unscathed in the book shrubs of the great basin hugh mozingo attributes this drought toughness to the scale like leaves because they are smaller and so closely appressed to the twigs these scale like leaves are a superior adaptation to the frequently very dry conditions in pinon juniper communities this herculean ability to survive on little water makes them a great addition to a dry garden but we may first have to get over our disdain for them as this poston chicago botanic gardens website puts it junipers have suffered from overuse and underimagination this article also examines our hatred of juniper bushes probably a bigger problem is that like so many other plants used in a landscape mature height and width often isnt taken into consideration and rather than removing a plant when it gets too big for the site sheers or a hedge trimmer are regularly deployed im not a huge fan of the sheered look i much prefer a more natural form to the boxes and globes that are so common in commercial and residential plantings im even less of a fan of the misguided inclination to force a plant to fit in a space that it isnt meant to be unless youre a bonsai artist i guess this treatment is what leads to exposing the ugly brown insides of a juniper shrub an unsightly look that only makes people hate them more brown insides of juniper shrub exposed after years of forcing the plant to fit in an improper site there are numerous commercially available cultivars of juniper species offering a plethora of sizes shapes and forms as well as various colors of foliage for small or narrow areas select dwarf varieties or columnar forms that wont need to be kept in check and in all cases let the plant express its authentic self controlling the urge to sheer and shape it against its will as if their natural beauty and low water requirement wasnt enough junipers are also great for supporting wildlife birds and other animals use them for cover and for nesting sites the fleshy cones are edible the shredding bark is used for nesting material and the evergreen foliage provides much needed protection during winter months oh and among many other benefitsthat junipers offer humans their aromatic fleshy cones have culinary value and are used to flavor gin i dont want to leave the impression that i am opposed to pruning and shaping shrubs for aesthetic reasons i think it should be done however my opinion is that unnatural shapes should be avoided sure boxed hedge rows have their place in certain types of gardens but my preference is towards more natural shapes the following video by university of illinois extension provides a brief tutorial on how to achieve that share this",

         "print what comes after the coronavirus outbreak politicians are discussing a huge economic stimulus package in many capitals and the central banks worldwide want to support this with cheap money the predicted decline of the global economy seems unprecedented in this form reconstruction of certain economic processes will be indispensable however it would be a historical mistake should it follow the classical pattern of building on fossil growth the industry is worried about the cuts that will be made in the protection measures against the coronavirus worldwide entire value chains have been disrupted and depending on how long the protective measures last there could be significant losses with serious consequences for a serious recession what does this mean for the european green deal europe set out to become the first continent to reduce co2 emissions to zero by 2050 commission vice president frans timmermans set out to examine all proposed legislation for compatibility with the european green deal at the same time an industrial strategy was launched that explicitly focused on supporting the deal the question now is if the coronavirus is putting a damper on these plans one thing is certain the temptation to restore essential elements of the classic fossil industry with reference to urgently needed economic growth will be hard to resist the czech republics prime minister has already called on the eu commission to concentrate on only fighting the virus and to put the european green deal on hold anticipated resistance could delay important decisions that are long overdue to achieve climate protection goals we must therefore start thinking now about how we can maintain a sustainable course and at the same time stimulate the economy many are already comparing the impact of the corona crisis with that of world war ii nothing will ever be the same again at that time there was a european recovery and reconstruction plan that came from the americans the famed marshall plan in fact it seems advisable to follow exactly this same template at the present time it was the greek philosopher heraclitus who coined the sentence everything flows panta rhei we should be guided by this idea in a sustainable recovery programme however if it is to flow in the right sustainable direction then the right incentives must be put in place the speed with which the eu finance ministers have set about providing national support programmes is remarkable the task now is to coordinate these huge financial packages and coupled with eu programmes to steer them in the direction of the european green deal it was very encouraging to see the reactions to the commissions direction towards sustainability there appears to be a fundamental willingness by europes industries to support brussels ambitious plan we should therefore not give any misleading signals that would make a return to the fossil economy even conceivable at the same time this means that the incentives to invest in sustainable projects must be very ambitious take hydrogen for example the eus hydrogen industry has proposed to scale up its capacity to produce up to 80 gw of green hydrogen by 2030 a roadmap for 40 gw electrolyser capacity in the eu by 2030 shows a 6 gw captive market hydrogen production at the demand location and 34 gw hydrogen market hydrogen production near the resource a roadmap for 40 gw electrolyser capacity in north africa and ukraine by 2030 includes 7 5 gw hydrogen production for the domestic market and a 32 5 gw hydrogen production capacity for export if a 240 gw electrolyser market in 2030 is realised alongside the required additional renewable energy capacity renewable hydrogen will become cost competitive with fossil grey hydrogen by realising a 240 gw electrolyser capacity producing green hydrogen about 82 million ton co2 emissions per year could be avoided in the eu the total investments in electrolyser capacity will be 25 30 billion euro creating 140 000 170 000 jobs in manufacturing and maintenance of 240 gw electrolysis and yet the industry needs the european union to design create and facilitate a hydrogen market that includes infrastructure and economy this could be achieved by a dedicated investment programme as part of the post corona recovery plan hydrogen technologies could help to boost the post corona economy not exclusively but definitely at the core of any recovery plan we should not be cynical yet the example shows that the coronavirus could also lead to an opportunity to align the interrupted value chains in a sustainable manner and to clearly orientate the development programmes towards decarbonisation climate protection should be the leitmotif of a massive development programme that could be called panta rhei the eu had set out to consistently tackle the paris climate protection goals also by means of the so called european green deal it does not to be sacrificed to corona reconstruction instead it is the other way around it becomes a rational pan the huge reduction in emissions caused by coronavirus should be the yardstick by which reconstruction must be measured the measures to combat covid 19 have already been anticipated at breathtaking speed many of the changes demanded by climate protectionists in recent months and years this includes less co2 emissions through the immediate reduction of flights through less traffic and through the interruption of value chains we currently assume that the reduction in emissions could be 40 to 45 dr patrick graichen director of agora energiewende said in reference to the situation in germany graichen recommends that the growth and economic stimulus packages being put together now should not only combat the consequences of the corona recession but must also help to make germany more climate proof in the long term indeed a growth package that would blindly promote fossil technologies would even be harmful because it would cement higher emissions in the long term the european green deal is europes new marshall plan the course must be set quickly and at the same time be ambitious now panta rhei everything flows let it flow in the right direction",

         "share this page on print primary content caption a us postal service employee unloads mail at a facility on february 10 2022 in houston texas on february 8 the house of representatives passed the postal service reform act of 2022 h r 3076 the legislation will address operational and financial issues that the agency has been grappling with for years a long awaited bill to fix the nation s deteriorating mail service is on the verge of passage in the senate but it could come at the expense of an even bigger and more complicated problem medicare solvency the postal service reform act of 2022would help shore up post office finances by ending the unusual and onerous legal requirement to fund 75 years of retirement health benefits in advance in return it would require future postal service retirees to enroll in medicare according to the congressional budget office the move could save the postal retirement and health programs about 5 6 billion through 2031 while adding 5 5 billion in costs to medicare during that span and probably much more in later years considering the massive size of medicare it spent 926 billion in 2020 the costs don t amount to much that small financial impact and the ongoing immediate crises with mail delivery probably account for the strong bipartisan support the postal bill has received in congress with 120 republicans joining democrats to pass the bill in the houseon feb 8 but late in the process some lawmakers are raising alarms over the move arguing that maybe congress should look more carefully at the financial impact to medicare s trust fund which is expected to run dry in 2026 this bill simply shifts risk to medicare recipients by adding billions of new costs to medicare sen rick scott r fla said feb 14 in blocking requests on the senate floor to expedite passage of the bill scott s objection delayed consideration of the bill until early march after the senate returns from its presidents day break currently postal service employees are covered by plans offered in the federal employees health benefits program when they retire they have several choices for health care including staying in their original plan or switching to medicare as their primary coverage and having an fehb plan serve as supplementary coverage about 20 of postal retirees do not sign up for medicare preferring their current federal plan under this legislation they would have to switch to medicare but they would keep a new postal service version of the fehb plan as secondary coverage since the change wouldn t fully take effect until 2025 and the congressional budget office s cost estimate doesn t capture a full decade scott wants to know the price tag for the next 10 and 20 year periods as well as the specific impacts on the various components of medicare such as premiums for medicare s part d drug plan and the part b program which covers a variety of outpatient services the overall cost is likely to be much more significant than the shorter term analysis found said robert moffit a senior fellow at the conservative heritage foundation who has also raised concerns there is a total cost that s being ignored moffit said you basically have a situation where you have unfunded liabilities in the postal service health benefits program retiree benefits that amount to about 75 billion that projected cost doesn t vanish it falls on medicare though the exact impact is unclear moffit agreed with scott that congress should be looking at longer term implications including effects on premiums and the costs borne by taxpayers and beneficiaries we ought to step back take a deep breath and look at what we re doing here moffit said postal service unions are not worried about the change however with all of them supporting the switch noted democrats who responded to scott earlier this month senate majority leader chuck schumer argued that the bill would save the government money overall and that moving postal retirees into medicare would ensure that they receive benefits they ve paid for but were not using for schumer and most other lawmakers the comparatively small impact on medicare is simply not as pressing as getting the mail delivered on time we will pass this bill because america needs it rural people need it senior citizens need it veterans need it 80 of the veterans prescriptions are sent through the mail schumer said nobody should be standing in the way of this bill scott is now among a minority objecting to the latest effort and pointing to medicare others who remain concerned about medicare s poor finances also thought fixing the problems with postal delivery was worth the cost to medicare i would let congress have a small win here and really this is not just a small win said mary johnson a social security and medicare policy analyst at the senior citizens league advocacy group she said the failures of the mail system also have health consequences with payments for insurance and shipments of prescriptions going missing which has happened to her the shift to medicare envisioned in the legislation could add to the sense of urgency all those retired postal workers would be joining medicare just in time for a solvency crisis if congress drags its feet it s inaction in congress that would cause that johnson said johnson noted it will be difficult to reach a bipartisan consensus on something as momentous as medicare reform you re going to have to pass something and it depends on who s the majority it may not be very pretty when it happens",

         "pin theres a special sort of fanfare in the whiskey community that is reserved for when a new distiller of kentucky straight bourbon officially comes of age this milestone is of course achieved when they release their first brand of straight bourbon which can technically be done after the whiskey has spent two years resting in newly charred oak barrels more commonly though distilleries opt to wait until the whiskey reaches four years old at which point it can legally be labeled as simply kentucky straight bourbon whiskey without any additional need for an exact age statement that is the moment when its generally reckoned that a distillery has officially graduated to becoming a full member of the kentucky bourbon community and for castle key that time has finally come castle key is a distillery that has had oceans and reams of copy written about it since co founders will arvin and wes murry purchased the defunct derelict site of the old taylor distillery which had been out of commission since 1972 after buying the site in 2014 and beginning its restoration into a modern distillery castle key has subsequently produced an array of new products including some really excellent punchy gin and the brands first whiskey restoration rye but a veritable army of kentucky bourbon obsessives have been patiently waiting on this release castle keys first branded kentucky straight bourbon there was so much anticipation in fact that bottles sold out in minutes lost in the shuffle meanwhile is the rather odd route that the brand has taken to get to this point after beginning its distilling operations in the mid 2010s the distillery garnered tons of headlines for its hiring of former brown forman distiller marianne eaves as its master distiller making her the first female master distiller working for a kentucky distillery since before prohibition eaves quickly became the focus of almost all of the companys pr over the next few years but she then seemingly unexpectedly left castle key in mid 2019 before any of the whiskey shed distilled for the company had ever been released subsequently eaves has referred to the experience positively as a fairy tale job but never quite explained why she decided to transition instead into a career of industry consultingand freelance blending distilling shes since given birth to her first child and launched a variety of initiatives including a blind tasting box service called eaves blind castle key meanwhile seemed to react to eaves departure by scrubbing whatever traces of the former master distiller still remained from the companys branding you wont find any reference to her in any of the company press releases announcing this bourbon for instance despite the fact that she presumably oversaw its initial distillation and aging nor has castle key ever seemingly hired or promoted another individual to the job title of master distiller having seemingly done away with the job title entirely since eaves left in 2019 curious if the company wanted to clarify this situation i reached out with some questions which received no reply it remains a confusing footnote in the castle key story edit after publication i heard back from a castle key representative who said the following after joining the castle key team marianne helped to develop castle keys recipes processes and oversaw distillation until 2019 she departed castle key before our whiskey was at a point of maturity castle keys new bourbon reflects the blending skills of jon brown castle keys quality manager who runs the research development department and brett connors who handles blending at the distillery on a day to day basis regardless we have a new bourbon to taste today castle keys bourbon mash bill is stated to be 73 white corn 10 rye and an unusually high 17 malted barley making this effectively something like a high malt bourbon this first release was created as two separate small batches of 80 barrels each both of which are blends of barrels aged 4 years theyre bottled at almost identical strengths of 49 98 proof for batch 1 and 49 5 99 proof for batch 2 my review sample is from batch 1 and both batches carry a roughly 50 msrp so with all that said lets get to tasting on the nose there are some classic elements here and also some notes that would seemingly imply this is still a fairly young spirit im getting both brown sugar and honey along with some more floral impressions fresh apples cola like spice dry roasted peanut shells and oak that has more than a little sawdust impression the latter note in particular feels like a more youthful one on the palate things turn sweeter with prominent notes of vanilla cream and simultaneous impressions of both honey and toffee its a little bit bready doughy likely from that higher share of malted barley in the grist along with impressions of cinnamon sugar and peanut brittle and more of that apple flesh the ethanol doesnt express itself in a particularly hot way on the palate but there is a certain raw booziness in terms of flavor that detracts a bit from the overall profile the finish meanwhile seems quite short to me seemingly disappearing moments after the initial sip and taste has abided all in all the profile simply isnt quite as bold as i hoped it might be at this proof point at the end of the day this is a fine kentucky straight bourbon and im glad that it carries a reasonable msrp of 50 in a beautiful bottle which is in line at least with what consumers now expect to pay for the first release from a smaller craft distillery but at the same time i feel this release may feel like something of a disappointment to some whiskey geeks who have been reading so much about castle key for so long and an indication that perhaps their spirit still needs more time to truly come into its own heres hoping that subsequent batches continue to mature or perhaps incorporate older spirit and that castle key continues to make strides forward in the meantime distillery",

         "the very worst place in the great lakes for an oil spill to happen the pipeline should not be there at all but now enbridge wants to go even further blasting a new underground tunnel beneath the straits to replace the existing underwater pipeline a broad coalition of michiganders have come together to oppose line 5 including michigan governor gretchen whitmer and attorney general dana nessel the msca was created by the states former republican governor rick snyder during his last days in office as a rubber stamp organization to legitimize enbridges interests so we were not surprised when the authority granted enbridge permission to move forward on the project but a storm is coming an elder woman from my tribe once recounted an anishinaabek prophecy to me a black snake would come to our land and try to poison our watersbut would end up uniting our people as never before this has come to pass in an unprecedented action all 12 federally recognized tribes in michigan came together to write a joint letter to president joe biden arguing that enbridges black snake under the straits violates treaties that the united states made with us as sovereign nations when it forced us to cede our land thinking about this on the drive back to detroit along i 96 through potawatomi land the words of the native poet musician and activist john trudell came to me every human being is a raindrop and when enough of the raindrops become clear and coherent they then become the power of the storm related articles wen stephenson waking up my own path to this clarity and coherence came into focus for me with a dream i had when i was 14 at the time i was being raised by my parents in the detroit area but i would go back every summer to my ancestral homelands just below the mackinac straits my family told me my dream was a healing dream and they helped me through the year long process of making a jingle dress and preparing to become a jingle dress dancer i have been dancing since that dream but in recent years as i have come to understand my heritage and witnessed the struggles in this country over land and water my own responsibility has come into sharper focus in 2016 i was a student at the new school in new york studying jazz when the battle erupted over the dakota access pipeline which was planned to run through sacred lakota land threatening the tribes water supply watching the protests at standing rock i realized how skewed the us legal system was against native people and against any efforts to protect the water current issue view our current issue the standing rock movement woke me upas it did so many native people of my generation the following year i returned to michigan and worked as a visual artist and musician in detroit i soon became increasingly interested in the water that surrounds us in the great lakes region after all the anishinaabek first migrated here from the east hundreds of years ago because of a prophecy that requires us to protect the water as i began to research the water beneath detroit i learned how dozens of rivers and streams were turned into drains and covered with concreteand then saw how inadequate this arrangement was during the terrible flooding last summer after monsoon strength rains hit detroit this led me to a conclusion every catastrophe that has befallen my state in recent memory has been a direct outcome of humans lack of respect for the water from the tragedy in flint to the 2010 kalamazoo river oil spill caused by another of enbridges pipelines to the flooding in detroit a disaster waiting to happen all of this led me to the disaster waiting to happen line 5s potential to defile the mackinac straits i am registered to the little traverse bay band odawa and it is our specific duty to protect the straits mackinac means place of the turtle and i am mud turtle clan i didnt set out to be an activist or to be involved in politics but when i heard that people were gathering last may to protest the pipeline i put on my jingle dress and showed up in november of 2020 governor whitmer revoked enbridges easement for the pipeline citing the unreasonable risk that continued operation posed to the surrounding waters and gave the company six months to shut down the line in may when that deadline expired the states lawsuits continued to progress but the oil continued to flow through line 5 currently line 5 carries light crude and natural gas liquids through michigan to ontario providing little or no benefit to michiganders enbridge argued that it was protected against michigan states actions by an overly broad reading of a 1977 treaty between the united states and canada guaranteeing the free flow of energy products between the two nations the canadian government invoked the transit pipeline treaty of 1977 in a bid to make this a federal issue those of us fighting the pipeline in michigan disagreeafter all it was the state that issued enbridges land use easement and the state is responsible for ensuring protection of the publicly owned waters of the great lakes but to the extent that line 5 is a federal matter we as native people hold a trump card we are a federal matter too the federal government has treaties with us guaranteeing our sovereignty and our rights to the land and the water these long predate whatever deal the united states made with canada in 1977 and certainly supersede it there is a precedent for this from within michigan itself when the five tribes including my own signed the 1836 treaty of washington that ceded the land that became michigan state we exchanged our land for perpetual fishing and gathering rights the apex of tribal fishing happens to be in the mackinac straits the breeding grounds for whitefish when the state told anishinaabek in the 1970s they could no longer use traditional gill nets and had to adhere to sports fishing rules the bay mills tribe took the matter all the way to the michigan supreme courtand won the tribes sovereign status was upheld according to the law we are no different than any other sovereign nation and only congress can change this we have rights to land and water that are guaranteed through a sovereign treaty enbridges failure to consult us let alone negotiate with us is a violation of this sovereignty ignoring the councils enbridge has made a mockery of our sovereignty by finding individual native supporters of the pipeline and using their views to cast doubt upon our unanimous and consistent opposition and so what enbridge imagines to be a winthat it can proceed with the tunnel because the canadian government is seeking to make this a federal issueactually shifts the struggle onto terrain where we have even more power to push back thanks to our federal recognition and all of this is happening at a pivotal moment for native peoplea time when others are truly listening to our voices in the movement for environmental ju",
